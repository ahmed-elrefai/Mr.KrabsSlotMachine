## __Introduction__:
this game is a small node js console project which might bring you some joy!<br>
it was made in less than one day by '_Ahmed Elrefai_' <br>
all the links are at the social section bellow.
> `disclaimer:` this has nothing to do with the actual show, it's just an idea that came to my mind. <br>
>  `another disclaimer:` this project __does not__ in any form encourage gambling or such. it's purely made for educational purposes. 

## __Installation & Perquisites.__
the game has two dependencies:
- [`npm` (node package manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- `prompt-sync` for recieving user input (to install: `npm i prompt-sync`) <br>
- to run the project you need to open the the project's directory in the terminal (cmd in windows)
  and run this command: `node project.js`
## __User Guide__
- you start the game with setting up your balance.<br>
you need to type in a numerical value or you will make Mr.Krabs Mad!<br>

- after that you choose the number of slot lines you want to bet on. (max 3)
- then you enter the amount of money you bet per line.
> `Note:` total money charged = slot_lines x bet per line.<br>
the more you bet, the risky it is! but as you win, you get more money from Mr.Krabs!
- at the end, you see your bet result in the slots, and prompted to play again if you want. <br>
